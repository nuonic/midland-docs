title: What is PathStack?
---

PathStack is an API-based toolkit for connecting, unifiying, sharing and analysing vehicle and asset tracking recorded by Telematics devices.

PathStack reduces the time and complexity of working with Telematics data from multiple sources by providing:
* A simple web interface to **connect Telematics Provider accounts** to your PathStack Tenant account. Send your users a web link and they just follow the steps to start sahring data.
* A **unified data model** that maps raw data from all providers to a single, consitent and rich structure. You always get the same respoonse structure no matter what source the data comes from. 
* A range of data access methods including **REST API** endpoints for static or historic data and **Websockets and Webhooks** for real-time events. Back-end methods such as AWS S3 file transfer are also available.
* Ability to configure **Data Sharing Rules** based on fixed or dynamic criteria. Your users can share data in confidence and within accepted terms of use.
* Endpoints for accessing complex or compute-intensive **multi-device analysis**, such as off-road usage analyis or journey ETA. Integrate analytics-driven outputs in to your platform quickly across all connected devices.

PathStack is designed to accelerate software development using vehicle and asset tracking data by handling the complexities of multiple telematics integrations, data mapping and analysis so our users can focus on building the user-facing or unique features that make their products valuable to their customers.
