title: What is PathStack?
---

PathStack is an API-based toolkit for connecting, unifying, sharing and analysing data from systems used to track and manage commercial vehicle operations. 

<Note>**PathStack currently supports integrations with Telematics (vehicle tracking) services for real-time and historic data.** Integrations to Freight Management, Facility Management and other operational systems are on our roadmap and expected to become available in the second half of 2024.</Note>

PathStack reduces the time and complexity of working with vehicle activity data from multiple sources by providing:
* A simple web interface to **connect Telematics Provider accounts** to your PathStack Tenant account, which that can be shared with a unique link.
* A **unified data model** that maps raw data from all supported providers to a single, consistent and rich structure so you always get the same response format no matter the source system.
* A range of data access methods including **REST API** endpoints for static or historic data and **Websockets and Webhooks** for real-time events. Other methods such as AWS S3 file transfer are also available.
* Ability to configure **Data Sharing Rules** based on fixed or dynamic criteria so users can share data selectively with confidence.
* Endpoints for accessing complex or compute-intensive **multi-device analysis**, such as off-road usage analysis or journey ETA's.

PathStack accelerates software development for connected vehicle platforms by handling the complexities of multiple telematics integrations, data mapping and analysis so you can focus on building the features that make your products unique.
