title: What is PathStack?
---

PathStack is an API-based toolkit for connecting, unifiying and analysing vehicle and asset tracking and telematics data.

PathStack removes the complexity of working with telematics data from multiple sources by providing:
* An easy to use interface for connecting accounts from a range of Telematics Service Provider's to your PathStack tenancy. Custom
* A unified output for all connected accounts and devices which maps the raw data from each provider or device type to a single, consitent and rich structure accessible via REST API or Websocket for live updates (the provider's original raw output is also available when needed).
* A set of functions that perform complex or compute-intensive analysis, such as spatial classifications or journey predictions, across all connected devices in a tenancy accessible via simple REST API calls.

PathStack is designed to accelerate software developement using vehicle and asset tracking data by handling the complexities of multiple data integrations, flows and analysis so our users can focus on building the user-facing or unique features that make their products valuable to their customers.
