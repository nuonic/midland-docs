title: Common Use Cases
---

PathStack provides configurable data sharing between operators of tracked vehicles and consumers who need to know where, when or what those vehicles are doing to optimise their operations. 

It adds value wherever indepedent parties need to share vehicle activity data, and the value compounds as the number of parties and telematics systems involved increases.

<Accordion title="Logistics Aggregation">
PathStack is used by Logistics Aggregators to connect live vehicle tracking data from independent Freight Carriers to the aggregator platform.  

Using PathStack provides Logistics Aggregators with these benefits:
- Build one integration, access live data from many telematics services. Reduces software build and maintenance costs and provides immediate access to supported providers.
- Avoids having to store access credentials from Frieght Carriers and utilises an independent third-party arbitrator to manage data access and sharing.
- Configure required data sharing parameters to include or exclude data so as to optimise efficiency and compliance obligations.
- Option to utilise additional real-time analysis across all connected devices. 

<Tip>Using PathStack means you don't need to integrate with 10+ systems to get live updates from your carrier's.</Tip>

<Accordion title="Freight Facility Scheduling">
PathStack offers Freight Facility Managers access to real-time status for Freight Carriers due to arrive and depart.  

Using PathStack provides Freight Facility Managers with these benefits:
- Real-time vehicle status updates to identify scheduling conflicts, missed slots or other disruptions as early as possible, allowing continuouse schedule optimisation.
- Avoids having to store access credentials from Frieght Carriers and utilises an independent third-party arbitrator to manage data access and sharing.
- Option to access full trip records to resolve disputes or adjust agreed proceedures with carriers.

<Tip>Schedule changes will always happen but Freight Terminal throughput and efficiency is maximised when those changes are known well in advance and can be adjusted for appropriately. PathStack gives you that early warning to avoid unneccessary costs for all parties.</Tip>

<Accordion title="Contractor Compliance Monitoring">
PathStack offers Mining, Energy and Industrial businesses access to activity and safety data from their Supplier or Contractor fleets when operating on their sites.  

Using PathStack provides these benefits:
- Standardisation of vehicle activity and safety event data, providing a single data source for all third-party vehicles operating on site.
- Significant reductions in work to complile and deliver compliance reporting for supplier fleets operating different tracking systems.
- Removal of reliance on suppliers to submit compliance data from telematics systems themselves.
- Simplified supplier onboarding and data connection process.

<Tip>PathStack can filter vehicle activity data based on location, using geofences for the specific locations to monitor. This provides Suppliers with assurance that only relevant data is shared, not data for other customers they work with.</Tip>
