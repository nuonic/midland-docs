To connect your Mix Telematics device integration with PathStack, you will need to obtain your Organisation Group ID, Client ID, Username and Password for accessing the API. The subsequent procedures will guide you through the process. 

<Steps>

  <Step title="Log into your MixFleet account">
To access your username, password and group Id, you will need to log into your MixFleet manager portal.  The password and username that you use to access the MixFleet portal are the same credentials that you will need for the API connection.
