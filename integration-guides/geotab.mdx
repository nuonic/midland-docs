  <Step title="Retrieve Database name">
    Once logged into your MyGeotab account, you will be able to retrieve your database name from the search bar at the
    top of your page. The database name sits in the search bar as `my.geotab.com/DatabaseName/#dashboard`. For example,
    in the image below the database name would be Nuonic.
