PathStack's integration with Digital Matter devices uses the real-time TCP connector which must be configured to send binary-encoded data to our server using the Telematics Guru platform. You must also provide us with the serial number of each device. Please contact us on 1300 822 370 or at support@nuonic.com.au to obtain the server address and initiate a Digital Matter integration.

For technical details in relation to the Telematics Guru configuration, please read Digital Matter's [connector guide](https://support.digitalmatter.com/integration/create-a-connector-set-up-an-integration).
