<Steps>
  <Step title="Get an integration link">
    To connect providers, you will need to obtain a connection link. To obtain a connection link, call the `/tenant`
    endpoint.

    ```python Python
    import requests

    url = "https://api.pathstack.io/tenant"
    headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer <access-token>"}

    response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers)

    connection_url = response.json()["data"]["connection_url"]
    print(connection_url)
    # example: https://portal.dev.pathstack.io/connect?code=83pbN8feZDK8F4L3rJH2fX-EsJS0MDEDKE0
    ```

    Replace `<access-token>` with an access token. You can find out how to get an access token [here](/content/authentication).

    This connection link is used to integrate with our partnered telematics providers. See a full list of supported
    providers [here](/in-depth/providers).

    This link is used to connect your telematics accounts to PathStack. You can do this yourself, or send this link to
    your clients. To connect an integration, select the telematics company in the list.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect your integration to PathStack">
    Now that you (or your client) have selected the integration, enter the details for the connection.

    The fields for **Business Name** and **ABN** are for identifying the telematics connection. The other fields are
    specific to each integration. In this example, you would need to provide the Verizon Connect App ID, and the
    username and password for accessing the API.

    <Note>All credentials are securely stored in PathStack once a telematics integration has been connected.</Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="You're connected!">
    Once you submit the form, PathStack will connect to the telematics provider you have selected and start pulling data
    in to PathStack. You can find the new connection by calling the `/connection` endpoint.

    <ConnectionSnippet />

    This will return a response that looks something like this:

    ```json JSON
    {
      "data": [
        {
          "integration_name": "verizon_connect",
          "business_name": "Bob's Trucking",
          "abn": "123456789",
          "email": "owner@bobstrucking.com.au",
          "active": true,
          "id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
          "tenant_id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6"
        },
        ...
      ]
    },
    ```

    Now that you have a connection, you can start [requesting data](/content/request-data)!

    <Note>It can take up to 30 minutes for data to flow from the telematics provider to PathStack</Note>
