Each telematics provider has different data processing times. These depend on things outside of PathStack's control,
including rate limits, pagination limits and data density. The table below shows estimated processing times for a day's
and a month's worth of data for each telematics provider.

<Note>
  The processing times assume <b>100</b> active devices
