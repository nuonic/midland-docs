title: Configuration and versioning
---

There are configuration settings that you can apply for your tenancy. The guide below shows how to configure these
settings.

## Modifying tenant configuration

To modify your configuration, use the `/tenant [PATCH]` endpoint. The body of the request should include the new values
of all fields that you would like to be changed. In the example code below, the `api_version`, `providers`, `logo_url`,
`name`, and `description` are changed. For a full list of configuration options, check out the [API reference](/api-reference/introduction).

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://api.pathstack.io/tenant"

payload = {
    "configuration": {
        "api_version": "2024-03-27",
        "providers": ["verizon_connect", "navman"]
    },
    "logo_url": "https://example.com/logo.png",
    "name": "New name",
    "description": "New description"
}
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <token>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.request("PATCH", url, json=payload, headers=headers)

print(response.json())
```

### Setting a logo

The `logo_url` field is used to set the logo of your account. This logo will be shown to users that connect to your
tenancy.

### Setting allowed providers

You can control which providers are enabled for connection using the `providers` field. You can set the field to a list
of providers which you would like to allow for connection to your account. If `providers` is set to null, which it is
by default, all providers are enabled for connection. For a list of provider names, check out the [API reference](/api-reference/introduction).

## API versioning

When writing production code, we recommend you add an `x-api-version` header to all requests. This will ensure that all
calls made to the PathStack API will be using the same API version and will allow control over when to upgrade versions.
If the `x-api-version` header is not passed, the version will default to the API version set in your configuration.

<Note>
  The first time that you make a call to the API without specifying the API version, we will set the API version in your
  tenant configuration to the latest version. All subsequent calls to the API where the `x-api-version` header is not
  sent will defer to using the API version set in the configuration.
</Note>

### Setting API version

To set/change the default API version of your account, use the `api_version` field. This will be used if you do not specify the version in the `x-api-version` header.
