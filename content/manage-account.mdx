title: Configuration and versioning
---

There are configuration settings that you can apply for your tenancy. The guide below shows how to configure these
settings.

## Modifying tenant configuration

To modify your configuration, use the `/tenant [PATCH]` endpoint. The body of the request should include the new values 
of all fields that you would like to be changed. In the example code below, the `api_version`, `providers`, `logo_url`,
`name`, and `description` are changed. For a full list of configuration options, check out the [API reference](/api-reference/introduction).

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://api.pathstack.io/tenant"

payload = {
    "configuration": {
        "api_version": "2024-03-27",
        "providers": ["verizon_connect", "navman"]
    },
    "logo_url": "https://example.com/logo.png",
    "name": "New name",
    "description": "New description"
}
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <token>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.request("PATCH", url, json=payload, headers=headers)

print(response.json())
```

### Setting a logo
The `logo_url` field is used to set the logo of your account. This logo will be shown to users that connect to your
tenancy.

### Setting allowed providers
You can control which providers are enabled for connection using the `providers` field. You can set the field to a list
of providers which you would like to allow for connection to your account. If `providers` is set to null, which it is
by default, all providers are enabled for connection. For a list of provider names, check out the [API reference](/api-reference/introduction).

### Setting API version
The `api_version` field is used to set the API version for your account. When breaking changes are made to the API,
PathStack pushes out a new version. When you first use the API, your account is locked to the latest API version. To
upgrade the version, you must set the `api_version` to the latest version code.

To test a new version, you can pass the version code in the `x-api-version` header. This will override the version set
in your account.
