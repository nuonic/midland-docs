PathStack supports realtime data access through many of our providers, you can find the list of supported providers
[here](/content/providers). We provide a direct connection to the telematics provider so you can get live data as soon
as possible.

## Applications

Applications for realtime data include:

- **Realtime Tracking of Vehicles in Your Fleet**

  We can provide the live location, as well as attributes such as speed
  and heading if they are available.

<Note>Trip milestones is an upcoming feature. Please contact us on 1300 822 370 to find out more!</Note>

- **Real-time ETA and Milestone Updates for Your Trip**

  If you give us details about your delivery such as the start point/time and end point/time, we can provide regular
  updates on ETA to the destination, as well as milestones during the delivery.

  These milestones include:

  - the delivery has started
  - the delivery has been delayed
  - the delivery has been completed
  - ...many others to come

## Getting started

Firstly, you'll want to check if your telematics provider supports realtime. To check, go to the
[Providers](/content/providers) page and see if your provider has **Real-Time Status** available, as not all providers
support this feature.

There are three methods of receiving realtime data from your telematics provider with PathStack. These are:

- Webhooks
- WebSockets
- Polling

The choice of which method to choose depends on your architecture and how you will be using the data. See the sections
below to understand the methods and the differences between each method.

## Realtime data collection methods

### Webhook

A webhook is an HTTP-based callback function that allows lightweight, event-driven communication between 2 APIs. To set
up a webhook, you will need to provide PathStack a unique URL, as well as filters defining what events PathStack should
send to your server. The URL must be able to accept POST requests.
To create a webhook, use the `/webhook [POST]` endpoint. For testing, you can use a webhook testing service such as
[https://webhook.site](https://webhook.site) to generate a URL that you can use for testing webhooks.

This will return a response that looks something like this:

```json JSON
{
  "data": {
    "filters": {
      "connection_ids": ["2b20295c-45f2-4a32-9042-6ce3cf917536"],
      "tags": ["new"],
      "device_ids": ["91618d7f-4826-44f3-a2ca-1165a6865a93", "3a08beab-426e-4c22-89b8-4e650f97f143"],
      "connection_devices": [
        {
          "connection_id": "2b20295c-45f2-4a32-9042-6ce3cf917536",
          "system_device_ids": ["vehicle1"]
        }
      ]
    },
    "options": {
      "include_speed": true
    },
    "url": "<webhook-url>",
    "enabled": true,
    "id": "f5782140-faa0-42c7-bc62-1f7a13135460",
    "error_count": 0,
    "last_error": null,
    "last_error_at": null,
    "created_at": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z",
    "updated_at": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z"
  }
}
```

You will now receive realtime position updates for all devices that match the filters that you have specified. For a
detailed overview of filters, read the section on [Filters](#filters). You can also specify options for the webhook. We
current support toggling speed.

The data that you will receive at the designated webhook URL will be of the format:

```json JSON
{
  "webhook_id": "6aafe01e-b7e6-4476-a888-ee1bb570ce5f",
  "payload": {
    "connection_id": "2b20295c-45f2-4a32-9042-6ce3cf917536",
    "device_id": "91618d7f-4826-44f3-a2ca-1165a6865a93",
    "system_device_id": "vehicle1",
    "position": {
      "timestamp": "2024-05-04T02:38:43.000000",
      "longitude": 144.4108704,
      "latitude": -37.1229045,
      "heading": 338.0,
      "speed": { "speed_kph": 82.521 }
    }
  }
}
```

### WebSocket

WebSocket is a protocol enabling simultaneous two-way communication over a single TCP connection. It allows full-duplex
interaction between a client and server with lower overhead compared to HTTP polling, facilitating real-time data
transfer. This protocol maintains an open connection, enabling the server to send content to the client without initial
client requests and allowing continuous message exchange.

When using WebSockets for realtime data collection with PathStack, you will have to first get a connection URL using the
`/realtime/connect` endpoint. This will return a unique URL which you can use to create a WebSocket connection with
PathStack. See below for an example of how to connect to PathStack over websockets using that URL. Note, you will need
to install the websockets library with `pip install websockets`.

```python Python
import asyncio
import websockets

async def connect():
    uri = "wss://api.pathstack.io/realtime/ws?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c"
    async with websockets.connect(uri) as ws:
        # set the filters and options for the WebSocket
        payload = {
            "filters": {"device_ids": ["91618d7f-4826-44f3-a2ca-1165a6865a93"]},
            "options": {"include_speed": True},
        }
        await ws.send(json.dumps(payload))

        while True:
          response = await websocket.recv()
          data = json.loads(response)
          print(f"Received {data}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(connect())
```

The data that you will receive from the WebSocket will be of the format:

```json JSON
{
  "connection_id": "2b20295c-45f2-4a32-9042-6ce3cf917536",
  "device_id": "91618d7f-4826-44f3-a2ca-1165a6865a93",
  "system_device_id": "vehicle1",
  "position": {
    "timestamp": "2024-05-04T02:38:43.000000",
    "longitude": 144.4108704,
    "latitude": -37.1229045,
    "heading": 338.0,
    "speed": { "speed_kph": 82.521 }
  }
}
```

If there are any errors, they will be received in the format:

```json JSON
{
  "error": "<error description>"
}
```

### Polling

Polling is another method of realtime data collection where a client continually requests data from a server (e.g.
making a request every second). PathStack provides a realtime positions endpoint that fulfills this requirement by
returning the most recent position of each device.

To get realtime positions using polling, use the `/realtime/device` endpoint. You can also pass through a filter and
options.

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://api.pathstack.io/realtime/device"

payload = {
    "filters": {
        "connection_ids": ["2b20295c-45f2-4a32-9042-6ce3cf917536"],
        "tags": ["new"],
        "device_ids": ["91618d7f-4826-44f3-a2ca-1165a6865a93", "3a08beab-426e-4c22-89b8-4e650f97f143"],
        "connection_devices": [
            {
                "connection_id": "2b20295c-45f2-4a32-9042-6ce3cf917536",
                "system_device_ids": ["vehicle1"]
            }
        ]
    },
    "options": {"include_speed": True}
}
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer <access-token>"}

response = requests.request("POST", url, json=payload, headers=headers)

print(response.json())
```

This will return a response that looks something like this:

```json JSON
{
  "data": [
    {
      "connection_id": "2b20295c-45f2-4a32-9042-6ce3cf917536",
      "device_id": "91618d7f-4826-44f3-a2ca-1165a6865a93",
      "system_device_id": "vehicle1",
      "position": {
        "timestamp": "2024-05-04T02:38:43.000000",
        "longitude": 144.4108704,
        "latitude": -37.1229045,
        "heading": 338.0,
        "speed": {
          "speed_kph": 82.521
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Filters

For realtime data you can provide filters to control what data you receive. Filters are optional, if no filters are 
provided then data from all devices will be sent.

There are 4 types of filters that you can utilise:
- Connection ID Filter

  You can specify the connection IDs that you wish to collect data for.

  `type: list of uuid`
- Tag Filter

  You can specify the tags of Devices which you wish to collect data for. This will only match devices which have
  **all** the specified tags.

  `type: list of string`
- Device ID Filter

  You can specify the device IDs that you wish to collect data for.

  `type: list of uuid`
- Connection Device Filter
  
  You can specify which system devices IDs for a connection to collect data for.

  `type: list of object with connection ID of type uuid and system device IDs of type list of string`

All filters will be applied to the data, so in order for a device to have it's realtime data collected, it must meet
all the filter criteria.
